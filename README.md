# Journal_App

This journal application, built using Spring Boot, allows users to effortlessly document their daily thoughts and moods. Users can record their entries in a user-friendly interface, making it easy to reflect on their experiences.

A unique feature of the application is its weekly email summary, which sends users an overview of their week every Sunday, highlighting their journal entries and moods from the previous week. This helps users stay engaged and reflect on their emotional journey over time.

To enhance performance and ensure a seamless user experience, I integrated Redis as a cache storage solution. User information and journal entries are securely stored in MongoDB Atlas for cloud database management. Additionally, the application utilizes Apache Kafka for efficient message processing, enabling reliable data handling and real-time updates.

This project not only demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack application but also showcases my understanding of microservices architecture and modern database solutions.
